My first contact with martial arts was in the wake of the Bruce Lee craze in the mid 70s, so I began doing some research into his style and discovered it was based on Ving Tsun; I found an address and duly went there which was in Earlham St. in the West End. In the window there was a pair of butterfly knives, a wooden man dummy, some sandbags and a pole. On entering, there were people sitting and talking awaiting their class to start. I waited for a while before a very fierce looking man, who turned out to be Grandmaster Victor Kan, sat down at a table and beckoned me forward. I asked a few questions and was struck by his no nonsense answers. It was then that I decided to join in 1979. In those days training was very strict and if you absorbed what was taught you moved to the next technique and not before. I enjoyed that way of learning - it gave you time to think about what you were doing. Between 1985-1989 I taught a small class under the auspices of GM Kan. I have stayed with my Sifu to this present day totalling some 41 years with many more to come, the last 25 years of this time has been spent acting as GM Kan's assistant instructor in the main school.
